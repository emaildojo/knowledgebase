## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital age, consumers have come to expect quick and seamless experiences across all devices. This is particularly true when it comes to email, as more and more people are checking their emails on mobile devices. According to Litmus, mobile devices accounted for 42% of all email opens in 2021, with the number expected to grow in the coming years.
[AMP emails](https://emaildojo.io/amp-editor-Gallery) , or Accelerated Mobile Pages emails, are a type of email that utilizes AMP technology to create more interactive and engaging email experiences. With AMP emails, you can include dynamic content such as interactive carousels, accordions, and forms, directly within the email itself, rather than requiring the user to click through to a separate webpage.
So, how do AMP emails work? Let's take a closer look.

## AMP HTML: The Foundation of AMP Emails
AMP emails are built using a subset of HTML known as AMP HTML. This type of HTML is designed to be lightweight and faster-loading than traditional HTML, making it ideal for mobile devices.
AMP HTML includes a number of specialized tags and components that allow you to create more interactive and engaging email experiences. For example, the amp-carousel tag allows you to create an interactive image carousel directly within the email, while the amp-accordion tag lets you create collapsible sections of content.
When a recipient opens an AMP email, their email client checks to see if the client supports AMP. If it does, the email client will render the AMP content directly within the email, allowing the recipient to interact with the dynamic content without leaving the email.

## Benefits of AMP Emails for Email Marketing 
So, what are the benefits of using AMP emails for your email marketing strategy?
Here are just a few:

1. Improved User Experience: By including dynamic content directly within the email, AMP emails provide a more engaging and interactive experience for recipients. This can lead to higher click-through rates and better engagement overall.

2. Faster Load Times: Because AMP HTML is designed to be lightweight and faster-loading than traditional HTML, AMP emails load more quickly on mobile devices. This can help improve the user experience and reduce the likelihood of recipients abandoning the email before it has even loaded.

3. Increased Conversion Rates: By providing a more engaging and interactive experience,  [AMP emails](https://emaildojo.io/amp-email-editor) can help increase conversion rates for your email marketing campaigns. Whether you're looking to drive more traffic to your website or encourage recipients to make a purchase, AMP emails can help you achieve your goals.

4. Mobile-Optimized: With more and more people checking their emails on mobile devices, it's important to ensure that your emails are mobile-optimized. AMP emails are specifically designed for mobile devices, making them an ideal choice for businesses looking to improve their mobile email marketing strategy.

5.  Email Deliverability: According to Google, emails that utilize AMP technology are more likely to be delivered to the primary inbox, rather than the promotions or spam folder. This can help improve the visibility of your emails and increase the likelihood that recipients will engage with your content.

## Best Practices for Using AMP Emails
Now that you understand the benefits of AMP emails, it's important to follow best practices when using this technology for your email marketing campaigns. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:
1. Test Your AMP Emails: Before sending out your AMP emails, it's important to test them across a variety of email clients and devices. This will help ensure that the emails are rendering properly and that the dynamic content is functioning as expected.

2. Keep It Simple: While AMP emails provide a lot of opportunities for dynamic content, it's important not to go overboard. Keep your design simple and focused on your main message. Use dynamic content to support your message, rather than overwhelming your recipients with too much information.

3. Use AMP for Specific Purposes: AMP emails are great for certain types of content, such as event invitations, product launches, and surveys. Use AMP for these types of emails to provide a more engaging and interactive experience for your recipients.

4. Provide a Non-AMP Version: While AMP emails are designed to be compatible with most email clients, there may be some recipients who are unable to view the AMP content. To ensure that everyone can view your email, provide a non-AMP version as well.

5. Follow Email Marketing Best Practices: In addition to following best practices for AMP emails, it's important to follow email marketing best practices as well. This includes segmenting your email list, personalizing your emails, and avoiding spam trigger words.
