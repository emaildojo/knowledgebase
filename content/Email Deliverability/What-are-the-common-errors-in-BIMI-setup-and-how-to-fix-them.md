## Introduction
In the ever-evolving world of email, marketers and businesses are constantly seeking new ways to stand out and build trust with their audience. One emerging trend is BIMI, which stands for Brand Indicators for Message Identification. BIMI allows you to display your brand logo directly in the recipient's inbox, adding an extra layer of authenticity to your emails. However, setting up BIMI can sometimes be tricky, and errors can occur along the way. Don't worry, though! In this guide, I'll walk you through the common mistakes that can happen during BIMI setup and provide simple solutions to fix them, all without any confusing technical jargon. So let's get started!

## Lack of Proper DNS Configuration:
One of the most common errors in BIMI setup is improper DNS configuration. DNS, which stands for Domain Name System, acts like a phonebook for the internet, translating domain names into IP addresses. To set up BIMI successfully, you need to make sure your DNS records are correctly configured.

**Solution:** Contact your domain or IT administrator and ask them to update the DNS records for your domain. They will need to add a BIMI-specific TXT record that contains the necessary information for your logo to be displayed. To check your DNS records you can use tools available on [Emaildojo](https://emaildojo.io/) .

## Invalid or Inaccessible Logo Image:
Another error that can occur is using an invalid or inaccessible logo image. BIMI requires a properly formatted SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file for your logo. If the file is corrupted or unavailable, your BIMI setup will encounter issues.

**Solution:** Check the format and accessibility of your logo image. Make sure it is in SVG format and accessible through a public URL. If necessary, consult with a graphic designer or use online tools to convert your logo to SVG format.

## Failure to Authenticate Emails with DMARC:
BIMI relies on DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) authentication to verify the legitimacy of your emails. If your DMARC configuration is incorrect or missing, BIMI won't work as expected.

**Solution:** Ensure that you have properly configured DMARC for your domain. DMARC helps prevent email spoofing and strengthens the security of your emails. Reach out to your IT or security team to assist you in setting up DMARC correctly.

## Unsupported Email Service Providers:
Not all email service providers support BIMI. If you're using an email service provider that doesn't yet offer BIMI integration, you won't be able to set it up directly.

**Solution:** Check with your email service provider to see if they support BIMI. If they don't, you may need to consider switching to a provider that does support BIMI or wait until your current provider adds support.

## Inadequate BIMI Record Validation:
During the BIMI setup process, there is a validation step to ensure that your BIMI record is correct. If the record fails validation, it won't be applied, and your logo won't be displayed.

**Solution:** Double-check your BIMI record for any errors or typos. Make sure the record is properly formatted and matches the requirements specified by BIMI validators. You can use online BIMI validators to verify the correctness of your record.

## Conclusion
BIMI is an exciting way to enhance your email branding and build trust with your recipients. While the setup process can be a bit challenging, understanding and troubleshooting common errors will help you navigate the path to successful BIMI implementation. By addressing DNS configuration, ensuring a valid logo image, authenticating emails with DMARC, verifying email service provider support, and validating your BIMI record, you'll be well on your way to displaying your brand logo proudly in recipients' inboxes. So go ahead, give BIMI a try, and elevate your email marketing game!
