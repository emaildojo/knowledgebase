## Product Carousel:
 Imagine a dazzling carousel of your products right in your emails. It's like a mini shopping festival in the Promotions tab! You can play around with the subject line, prices, product names, and your logo. 
 
 Showcase your products - they could be the same as in your email or entirely different. Itâ€™ll be taken directly to your product website - more engagement and a higher chance of conversions.

## Single Image Preview: 
Not in the carousel camp? No problemo! If your business revolves around one star product, or if you've built your email around a certain item, show it off with a single image preview. And hey, we support various aspect ratios, with high quality, however we recommend having 2:3, 4:5, 1:1, 3:2, and 1.91:1 so your image will always look its best. Pique your recipient's curiosity with stunning images that scream, "click me!"

Before you jump into the annotations bandwagon, though, remember a few prerequisites:

**Email Authentications:** Don't be that shady guy in the corner. Make sure your emails pass SPF, DKIM, and DMARC checks. This is the bouncer at the club - it ensures your emails are legit and can enter the inbox.

**Picture Perfect:** Your images need to be as sharp as a tack. High-quality images make your emails look professional and attractive. Remember, you're aiming for love at first sight here!

**Whitelist the Sender Address:** Make sure your sender address is on the good list. Get in touch with your email administrator to make sure your address is whitelisted, unlocking the full power of Gmail annotations.

## Finally, a few points to keep in mind:

**Check Your Work:** The Gmail Promo Annotation Builder lets you preview and test your annotations. Think of it as your magic mirror telling you if your annotations are the fairest of them all.

**Mass Email Requirement:** Gmail needs to identify your emails as mass emails to render your email as annotation. That means sending to a minimum of 1,000 recipients. No shortcuts here!

**Carousel Limit:** Gmail limits the number of carousels displayed simultaneously. So if you don't see yours, it doesn't mean it's not working!

**Tracking:** So far there's no way to track who gets annotations and who gets standard emails. But hey, with all the extra engagement and conversions, who's complaining?

So, there you have it! Gmail Annotations: your secret weapon to standing out in the Gmail Promotions tab. Go ahead, give it a spin, and watch your email marketing game level up!
