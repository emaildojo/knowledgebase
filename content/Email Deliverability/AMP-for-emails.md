## Introduction to AMP emails

Email marketing has come a long way since its inception, but there is always room for innovation and improvement. This is where AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) comes in, as it offers a faster and more interactive way of creating and displaying email content.

In this article, we will explore AMP emails and their benefits, as well as the technical details of how to create and send them.

## What are AMP emails?

AMP emails are a new type of email format that is based on AMP technology. AMP is an open-source HTML framework developed by Google that enables web pages to load faster and provide a more seamless user experience.

AMP emails are essentially emails that use AMP HTML to provide a more interactive and dynamic experience for the reader.

## Benefits of using AMP emails

There are several benefits to using AMP emails, including:

- Improved engagement: AMP emails offer a more engaging experience for readers, with interactive components such as forms, quizzes, and product carousels.

- Increased conversion rates: With the ability to include dynamic content and calls-to-action, AMP emails can help improve conversion rates.

- Better performance: AMP emails are designed to load quickly and provide a seamless user experience, which can improve deliverability rates and overall performance.

## How AMP emails work?

AMP emails are built using AMP HTML, which is a subset of HTML that includes additional components and functionality.

These components include AMP scripts, which are custom JavaScript libraries that enable AMP-specific functionality, and AMP elements, which are HTML tags that provide additional functionality.

To send an AMP email, you will need to use an email service provider (ESP) that supports AMP emails. When the email is sent, the email client will check if the email is an AMP email and if it is supported by the email client.

If the email is supported, the email client will display the AMP content, otherwise, it will display a fallback version of the email.

## How to Create an AMP email?

Creating an AMP email requires a basic understanding of AMP HTML and access to an AMP email editor or builder.

The following is an example of a simple AMP email with an image, a heading, and a call-to-action button:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html âš¡4email>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <style amp4email-boilerplate>body{visibility:hidden}</style>
  <script async src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js"></script>
  <script async custom-element="amp-img" src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-img-0.1.js"></script>
  <title>Welcome to AMP email</title>
  <link rel="canonical" href="self.html">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1">
  <style amp-custom>
    h1 {
      font-size: 24px;
      color: #333;
      margin: 10px 0;
    }
    button {
      padding: 10px;
      background-color: #007bff;
      border: none;
      border-radius: 5px;
      color: #fff;
      text-align: center;
      display: inline-block;
      margin-top: 20px;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to AMP email</h1>
  <amp-img src="https://amp.dev/static/samples/img/amp.jpg" width="600" height="400" layout="responsive" alt="AMP image"></amp-img>

## How to Test AMP Emails?

Testing AMP emails is crucial to ensure that they are rendering correctly across various email clients and devices. Here are some tools and techniques to test AMP emails:

1. AMP Validator: The AMP validator is an online tool that checks the syntax and structure of your AMP email code. You can either paste your code or provide a URL to your AMP email in the validator to check for errors.

2. Litmus: Litmus is a popular email testing tool that allows you to test your AMP emails on over 90 email clients and devices. It also provides insights into the performance of your email, such as open rates and click-through rates.

3. Email on Acid: Email on Acid is another email testing tool that supports AMP email testing. It allows you to preview your email on over 70 email clients and devices and provides feedback on potential rendering issues.

4. Manual Testing: Manual testing involves sending your AMP emails to a small group of people and requesting their feedback.

This approach is ideal for testing the user experience and ensuring that your emails are easy to read and navigate. You can use [AMP email editor](https://emaildojo.io/amp-email-editor) to build new templates.

## Best Practices for Creating AMP Emails

To create effective and engaging AMP emails, here are some best practices to follow:

1. Keep it Simple: Keep your AMP emails simple and easy to read. Avoid using too many images or animations, as they may distract the reader from the main message.

2. Use Personalization: Use personalization to make your AMP emails more relevant and engaging. You can include the recipient's name or other details to create a more personalized experience.

3. Include a Clear Call to Action: Include a clear call to action in your AMP email to encourage the recipient to take action. Use action buttons or links that are easy to click and stand out from the rest of the content.

4. Optimize for Mobile: Optimize your AMP emails for mobile devices as most people access their emails on their smartphones. Use a responsive design that adjusts to the screen size of the device.

5. Test and Iterate: Test your AMP emails thoroughly and iterate based on the feedback you receive. Continuously improve the user experience and engagement by making tweaks and adjustments.

## Conclusion

AMP emails provide a new way for marketers to create engaging and interactive email experiences that can improve customer engagement and increase conversion rates.

By following the best practices and using the right tools, you can create effective and engaging AMP emails that stand out in the inbox and drive results.
