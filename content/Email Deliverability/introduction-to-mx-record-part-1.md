## Introduction

MX record, also known as a mail exchange record, is a crucial element of the Domain Name System (DNS) that aids in email delivery. MX records essentially inform email servers where to send emails for a specific domain. Emails couldn't reach their intended recipients without MX data.

This article will examine MX records in more detail, explaining how they function and why email delivery depends on them. Also, we'll go through the various MX record kinds and how to set them up for your domain. Understanding MX records can assist you in ensuring the quick and effective delivery of emails, whether you are an IT expert or the owner of a website. So, let's dive in and explore the world of MX records.

## what are MX record ?

MX records, which stand for "mail exchange record," are a class of DNS (Domain Name System) resource records that identify the mail server in charge of receiving email on behalf of a certain domain.

In other words, your email client consults the recipient's MX record to determine the email's destination when you send it to them. The priority of the mail server, the server name, and other details are included in the MX record, which establishes the sequence in which the servers should be reached for email delivery.

The effective delivery of email messages depends on MX records.Email servers would not know where to send messages without them, and they would probably be lost or unable to be delivered. In order to ensure dependable email transmission, MX records must be configured appropriately.

## How do MX record works ?

When you send an email, your email client connects to your email provider's outgoing mail server. The outgoing mail server then looks up the recipient's domain name to find the MX record associated with that domain.

The MX record specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for that domain, and the outgoing mail server uses this information to deliver the email to the appropriate server. The recipient's email client can then retrieve the email from their mail server.

In this diagram, a user's email client initiates an email message to a recipient's email address. The user's email provider's outgoing mail server performs a DNS lookup to find the MX record associated with the recipient's domain name. The DNS server responds with the MX record, which contains the name and priority of the mail server responsible for handling email for that domain.

The outgoing mail server then connects to the recipient's mail server to deliver the email message. If the first mail server is unavailable, the outgoing mail server will try the next mail server in the priority list until the email message is successfully delivered.

Overall, the process of MX record lookups and email delivery is critical to ensuring reliable email communication.

## Why are MX Records important?

MX records are important for email communication since they identify the mail server(s) in charge of managing email messages for a specific domain. Without MX records, email servers would be unable to determine where to send messages, which could result in lost or undelivered emails.

In the event that a mail server goes down, MX records also provide redundancy and failover. If the primary server is down, email messages can still be sent to alternative servers by specifying multiple mail servers with varied priority in the MX record.

In conclusion, MX records are necessary to make sure that email messages are delivered effectively and consistently. They enable redundancy and failover in the event of server outages or other issues and give the information required to route email traffic to the appropriate mail servers.

## How to configure/create an MX record?

There are a several steps involved in configuring an MX record, depending on the DNS hosting service or DNS administration application being utilised. The method typically includes the following steps:

1. Go to the DNS settings for your domain after logging in to your DNS hosting service or DNS management application.

2. Find the MX record settings and enter a new record information.

3. Please provide the hostname of the mail server that will be handling your domain's email delivery.

4. Set the MX record's priority value. The sequence in which mail servers are tested to send email messages is determined by this parameter. Higher priority mail servers are indicated by lower priority levels.

5. You should save the DNS configuration changes.

Make that the mail server hostname listed in the MX record is accurate and refers to a reliable and accessible mail server. To ensure consistent and redundant email delivery, it is also advised to set up numerous MX records with various priority values.

Always make a backup of your current DNS settings before making any changes in case something goes wrong. Also, it's crucial to give DNS changes enough time to spread throughout the Internet.

## How to check MX records?

There are several ways to check the MX record for a domain:

1. Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux): Open Command Prompt or Terminal and use the nslookup command followed by the domain name. For example, to check the MX record for "example.com," enter the following command:

```bash
nslookup -type=MX example.com
```

The MX records connected to the domain will be shown.

2. Online MX record lookup resources: A number of internet resources are available that let you check a domain's MX record. Best you can choose [Emaildojo's MX record checker](https://emaildojo.io/mx-record-lookup)

3. Using an email client: You may also check a domain's MX record by setting up an email account in your email client with the relevant domain name. You may access the server settings, which contain the MX record information, after the account has been set up.

Regardless of the approach you take, checking a domain's MX record can be useful for resolving email delivery problems or confirming that email is reaching the right mail servers.

## Understanding MX record's component

When an email is sent, the outgoing mail server looks up the MX record associated with the recipient's domain to determine where to send the message.

MX records have several important components, including:

1. Priority: The priority specifies the order in which mail servers should be used for email delivery. If the primary mail server is unavailable, the next mail server with the next highest priority will be used.

2. Name: The name field specifies the domain name of the mail server responsible for handling email for the domain.

3. TTL (Time-to-Live): The TTL specifies the length of time the MX record should be cached by other DNS servers before checking for updates.

Changes to MX records might take up to 24-48 hours to propagate throughout the DNS system. MX records can be changed through a domain registrar or DNS hosting provider.

For the purpose of maintaining reliable email delivery and troubleshooting email delivery issues, understanding MX records is crucial. You can make sure that your email messages are sent to the appropriate mail server(s) and prevent any email delivery issues by understanding how MX records function and how to maintain them.

- **MX Record Syntax**

The syntax for an MX record consists of three parts:

The first part is the name of the mail exchange host. This is typically a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) such as "mail.example.com".

The second part is the priority value, which is a non-negative integer between 0 and 65535. Lower values indicate higher priority.

The third part is the class, which is usually "IN" (Internet).

The syntax for an MX record looks like this:

```bash
mail.example.com.     IN      MX      10      mailserver.example.com.
```

In this example, "mail.example.com" is the domain name for which the MX record is being set, "IN" is the class (Internet), "MX" is the record type, "10" is the priority, and "mailserver.example.com" is the mail exchange host.

- **Priority values in MX records**

An MX record's priority values specify which mail servers should be used for email delivery in what order. The mail server's priority is determined by how low the priority value is.

One mail server will be chosen for email delivery before the other, for instance, if a domain has two MX records, one with a priority value of 10 and the other with a priority value of 20. The mail server with a priority value of 20 will be used as a fallback in the event that the primary mail server is down.

It's important to remember that priority values do not have to be sequential and that the same priority value may be shared by numerous MX records. For email delivery, the outgoing mail server will pick one MX record at random if two of them have the same priority value.

MX record priority values are defined using a non-negative integer between 0 and 65535. The most common priority values are 10, 20, 30, and so on, but any valid integer can be used.

- **Can a domain have Multiple MX records**

You can have more than one MX (Mail Exchange) record for a domain. In reality, it's normal practise to have numerous MX records, which can increase email delivery dependability and redundancy.

Each record's priority value indicates the order in which the mail servers should be used to send emails when a domain has multiple MX records. It will first try the mail server with the lowest priority value. The mail server with the next lowest priority value will be tried if that one is unavailable, and so on until a mail server is discovered that is available to accept the email message.

- **Example of Multiple MX record**

Here's an example of multiple MX records for a domain:

```bash
example.com.    IN    MX    10    mail1.example.com.
example.com.    IN    MX    20    mail2.example.com.
example.com.    IN    MX    30    mail3.example.com.
```

In this example, the domain "example.com" has three MX records with different priority values. The mail server with the lowest priority value of 10 is "mail1.example.com", the second mail server with a priority value of 20 is "mail2.example.com", and the third mail server with a priority value of 30 is "mail3.example.com".

When an email message is sent to an email address at "example.com", the outgoing mail server will attempt to deliver the message to the mail server with the lowest priority value first, which is "mail1.example.com". If that server is not available, the mail server with the next lowest priority value will be tried, and so on, until a mail server is found that is available to accept the email message.

## Conclusion

To summarize, MX records play a crucial role in directing email messages to the appropriate mail servers for delivery. These records contain information about the mail server's hostname and priority value, and having multiple MX records is recommended for reliability and redundancy.
