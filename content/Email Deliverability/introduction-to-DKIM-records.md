## Introduction

Email authentication is an essential part of securing your organization's email infrastructure. As the prevalence of phishing attacks and email-based fraud continues to rise, it's more important than ever to verify the authenticity of the messages you send and receive. One important tool in the email authentication toolkit is DKIM records.

By using DKIM records, you can add an extra layer of security to your email setup and help protect your organization and your customers from email-based threats.

In this guide, we'll explore the benefits of DKIM records, how to create and implement them, and best practices for using DKIM records effectively.

## What is a DKIM record?

A DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) record is a type of email authentication that enables a company to accept accountability for the messages it sends. A DNS (Domain Name System) record known as a DKIM record contains cryptographic signatures that are appended to the email message header. Receiving mail servers check these signatures to ensure that the email is legitimately from the claimed domain.

Email deliverability can be increased, spoofing and phishing attacks can be stopped, and the overall security of your email infrastructure can be strengthened by adding a DKIM record to your email configuration.

## Benefits of having a DKIM record

DKIM records are useful for email authentication for a number of reasons:

1. **Reputation management**: By ensuring that your legitimate email messages are correctly authenticated and not misinterpreted for spam or fraudulent messages, DKIM records can benefit your organization's reputation.

2. **Compliance**: Many laws and guidelines, such as DMARC, GDPR, and HIPAA, demand for email authentication. You can show your organization's dedication to email security and compliance by using DKIM records.

3. **Brand protection**: By preventing unauthorised use of your domain for email messages, DKIM records can help safeguard your brand and reputation.

4. **Improved deliverability**: By lowering the possibility that your emails will be blocked or redirected to spam folders, DKIM records can increase email deliverability.

5. **Reduced risk of phishing and spoofing attacks**: DKIM records add an extra layer of authentication to your email messages, making it more difficult for attackers to spoof your domain and impersonate your organization.

Overall, adding DKIM records to your email authentication strategy is a key step in securing the integrity and validity of your email messages as well as safeguarding your company from dangers that can be transmitted via email.

## What are information is required for creating DKIM record?

To create a DKIM record, you need the following information:

1. Domain name: The domain name for which you want to create a DKIM record.

2. Selector: A string that identifies the specific key used to sign the email messages. A selector can be any string of up to 32 characters in length and must be unique for each DKIM key pair associated with a domain.

3. Public key: The public key that is used to verify the signature on the email message. The public key is generated when the key pair is created and should be published in your domain's DNS.

4. Signing algorithm: The algorithm used to create the signature on the email message. Common signing algorithms include RSA and SHA256.

5. Private key: The private key is used to sign the email messages. This key must be kept secure and should not be published in DNS.

Once you have all of this information, you can create a DKIM record by adding a TXT record to your domain's DNS. The TXT record should include the domain name, selector, and public key, along with any other necessary information such as the signing algorithm.

## How to create a DKIM record?

This process can be somewhat technical, requiring some knowledge of DNS and cryptography. However, many email service providers and DNS hosting providers offer simplified tools or interfaces for creating DKIM records, making it easier for users to implement this important email authentication method.

1. Generate the public and private key pair: The first step in creating a DKIM record is to generate a public and private key pair. This can typically be done using a DKIM key generation tool or by using a command line interface.

2. Publish the public key in DNS: Once the key pair has been generated, the next step is to publish the public key in your DNS. This is typically done by adding a TXT record to your DNS zone file. The value of the TXT record should contain the public key.

3. Create the DKIM record: The DKIM record itself is a TXT record that includes several pieces of information, including the selector (a string that identifies the specific key used to sign the message), the domain name, and the public key.

4. Add the DKIM record to DNS: Once the DKIM record has been created, it should be added to your DNS zone file as a TXT record.

5. Test the DKIM record: After the DKIM record has been added to DNS, it's important to test it to ensure that it's working correctly. This can be done using various DKIM testing tools available online, [DKIM checker](https://emaildojo.io/dkim-checker).

Also, you can create a DKIM record by using various tools available online. One of the way of creating DKIM record is using the [Free DKIM Generator](https://emaildojo.io/dkim-generator)

It's worth noting that the specific steps for creating a DKIM record may vary depending on the email service provider or DNS hosting provider that you're using. It's important to refer to their documentation and guidelines for specific instructions on how to create a DKIM record in their systems.

## Troubleshooting common issue in DKIM record

Some common issues that can arise when implementing DKIM records, along with some troubleshooting steps:

1. Email failing DKIM check: If an email fails the DKIM check, it could be due to an error in the DKIM record. Check that the domain name, selector, and public key in the DKIM record match the values in the email header. You can also use a DKIM checker tool to validate the DKIM record and ensure it's set up correctly.

2. DNS propagation delays: It can take some time for DNS changes to propagate across all DNS servers. If you have just added or updated your DKIM record, you may need to wait up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect.

3. Incorrect formatting: DKIM records must be formatted correctly in the DNS. Ensure that the record is properly formatted as a TXT record and that there are no syntax errors.

4. Selector name clashes: If you have multiple DKIM keys for the same domain, ensure that each key has a unique selector name. If selector names clash, emails may fail the DKIM check.

5. Private key loss: If you have lost your private key, you will need to generate a new key pair and update your DKIM record. Make sure to keep your private key secure and backed up to avoid this issue.

By troubleshooting these common issues, you can ensure that your DKIM record is correctly implemented and that your emails are authenticated properly.

## Best practices for testing DKIM records

1. Test with a DKIM checker tool: Use a [DKIM checker tool](https://emaildojo.io/dkim-checker) to validate your DKIM record and ensure it's set up correctly. This will help you identify any issues before sending emails.

2. Test with different email providers: Test your DKIM record with multiple email providers, including popular ones like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook. This will help ensure that your emails are authenticated correctly for all recipients.

3. Send test emails to yourself: Send test emails to yourself or to a colleague to ensure that the DKIM signature is added to the email header and that the email passes the DKIM check.

4. Check the DKIM signature in email headers: Check the email header of a received email to ensure that the DKIM signature is added to the header and that it matches the domain name, selector, and public key in your DKIM record.

5. Monitor email delivery and reputation: Keep an eye on your email delivery and reputation after implementing DKIM. This will help you identify any issues that may arise and ensure that your emails are being authenticated correctly.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your DKIM record is set up correctly and that your emails are authenticated properly. This will help improve your email deliverability and protect your email reputation.
